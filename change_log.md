## Change Log

### bear_export_sync.py

#### Version 1.7.4 - 2018-11-20 at 21:46 IST - Updates:
- Fix on issue #18: emtpy arguments confuses rsync! in 'def rsync_files_from_temp()'

#### Version 1.7.2 - 2018-11-18 at 17:15 IST - Updates:
- Added and tidied up comments sections and reordered some code lines, but no real code changes.

#### Version 1.7.1 - 2018-11-17 at 22:06 IST - Updates:
- Refactored code: Now using the 'argparse' library instead of clunky, home-made CLI function.  
Thanks to @motin for that pull-request and code suggestion :)
- Updates shell script sample for easy run with various choices and multiple outputs.
- Command line argument for sync-back to Bear is now default off for security reasons. 
  It's also not a toggle, but have to be turned on explicitly with: "-s=1" or "--do_sync=true"

#### Updates 2018-11-16:
- Fixed: tags getting HTML comment in code-blocks
- Fixed: tags or tag-like code, in codeblocks no longer exported in folders
- Simplified code in function: 'sub_path_from_tag()' used above

### Warning

**Please discard versions 1.5.x !**

> It introduced CLI argument '-o' for export path, where it is possible to enter any user path. 
> 
> So if one accidentally entered root of an existing folder, all other files and folders there, would be deleted (by rsync) when running 1.5.x !
> 
> This is now corrected from version 1.6.0, by always adding 'BearNotes' to whatever path users supply with the '-o' argument. It's now (once again) hardcoded for your safety.
> 
> As always: please take a full backup of Bear and a full backup of your Mac before running new versions or when changing CLI arguments. 
> 
> Apologies and hope nobody ran into this problem/SNAFU :)
